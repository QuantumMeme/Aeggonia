There are three types of beings that are above and beyond mortals, to the point that they are objects of their worship.

# [[Elder Dragons]]
These dragons stand at the apex of the mortal realm-- a shining example of the peak of creation. They are immensely powerful, commanding an element and fostering a bloodline that never seems to die.

# [[Deities]]
The manifestation of concepts dreamt by the mortals. Some hold more weight than others-- though it is forbidden to alter the course of history that the mortal coil writes for itself-- even if it is hell-bent on tearing itself apart.
# [[Titans]]
Titans are beyond strength. They simply *are*. The three of them represent the world in of itself. The land. The sea. The _world itself_. They are gargantuan beings beyond comprehension. Bear in mind... it took two to shatter Aeggonia as it knew itself. None alive have seen them apart from the elder dragons-- and none of them have ever met with the worldvein itself.

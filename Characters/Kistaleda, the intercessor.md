Voice of the Spine, Atlas of the [[Spark]].

Once a mortal girl-- a daughter of a trader-- she haphazardly stepped on the singular shard of the spine that jutted from the earth like a dagger. The moment it pierced her flesh it fused with her. Blood to glass, bone to diamond, her body was slowly being consumed by the crystalline rot. Any attempt to free her would result in the crystal bursting with pure energy and knocking everyone back, even killing some.

That little girl exists no longer. There is only the Spine within her, now.

The Intercessor cannot leave the small confines around the Spine itself and exists now only to intercede for it. While it can communicate directly with those who bear its crystal, only she is attuned enough to understand it clearly. She is the de facto leader of the Spark-- the prophet.

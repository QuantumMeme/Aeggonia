The Coalition is barely a country. It is a collection of independent warbands, bandit companies, and tribes that cooperate with each-other in matters of trade. They formed out of necessity-- united under the banner of the orcs of Urrarkaad. After the Reckoning, that region of the archipeligo was embroiled in a violent war. As different races and species were displaced, they all clawed for any semblance of power. The orcs were the most successful-- slaughtering anyone who stood in their way.

Eventually, shockingly, the orcs proposed a treaty. One that was disseminated among the entirety of Adalwin. The deal was simple: economic collaboration. The vast majority of the groups made their money through illicit trades, and as such there was a massive benefit into turning into a syndicate of sorts. Each tribe is treated as an individual cartel, and trade is completely free between them.

That does not mean that relations must be amicable, however. Land grabs, slavery, and treachery is rampant in the coalition, making it a vastly dangerous place to enter. It is the most diverse country in the world, even being the host of a tribe containing the last living tritons.

If you need something specific that's "hard to come by," this is where you'll find it. Just try to stay in Urrarkaad if you can.

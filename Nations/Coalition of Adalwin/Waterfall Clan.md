Another of the once unified clans. The waterfall clan is entirely about embracing change. The world shifts and they must adapt. There is no use fighting the river, it will erode your attempts at keeping the old ways. Because of this, they fully embrace the criminality of the coalition-- making extremely potent hallucinogens and making their money like that. They are primarily martial artists and very spiritual, but they are not to be underestimated. There are powerful mages among them, something they say is a divine blessing bestowed unto them by their late prophet.

They worship the goddess [[Deities#Fluox - Goddess of Change |Fluox]].

This is what the Highfang wanted.

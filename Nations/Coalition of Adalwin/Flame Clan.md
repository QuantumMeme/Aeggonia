The Flame Clan is an inhospitable place. 

Embers float aimlessly around you, biting your skin as you pass through them like swarms of angry gnats leaving reddened, stinging welts in their wake. You pass trees with twisted,  blackened trunks and branches, their leaves engulfed in flame but never burning up as if they themselves were the coals feeding the fire. Their veins flicker with white-hot chlorophyll that had learned to burn, pulsing with life among the eternally dying landscape.  The soil underfoot was cracked and brittle, with the pressure of your footfalls being enough to split it open. Fissures form with an angry hiss, tongues of flame being freed from its earthen prison and lapping angrily at the party as if thirsting for the water within you. The jungle was far from dead as it would first appear-- but rather it was teeming with furious, agonizing life. There were no fruiting trees to offer respite, no creeks to fuel the trek-- this is a forest that bore no gifts; this was a forest that only offered a test to your endurance.

Those accustomed to this place's torrid landscape find it easier to put up with the unbearable heat. Those who aren't must simply suffer.

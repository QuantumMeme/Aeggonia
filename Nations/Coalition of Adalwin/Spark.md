They sprouted after a crystalline shard jutted out of the ground, jagged and twisted. The landscape around it would slowly die as the shard would grow, the formation in the center growing slowly into a short wall-like segment. Even among the Flame Clan's overzealous razing, the Spark was a barren waste.

The shard is known as the **Spine**, and those close enough to it for long enough will be imbued with its power... physically. One will feel compelled to snap a small shard of the crystal from the formation and dig it into their foreheads where it will subsequently fuse with bone. The cultists call themselves, or rather the Spine calls them its **Vertebrae**. 

At the forefront is the very first vertebra-- [[Kistaleda, the intercessor]]. She speaks for the Spine and lives in service to it-- if you can call it a life. 

In truth, the Spine is a shed scale from the Worldvein making its way up to the surface.

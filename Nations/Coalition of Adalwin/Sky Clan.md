One of three once unified clans. The sky clan is obsessed with ascension, thinking that the treetops are their domain as to be closer to the gods above. They have aerial mounts like gryffins and gliders-- taking inspiration form Aethan warfare. They are mechanically inclined and are very proficient in fletching. They believe that conflict breeds survival, and as such they attempt to instigate their neighbors as much as possible. Of course, they are willing to sell their bows to anyone but them. The strong must rise above and lead.

This is what the Highfang wanted.

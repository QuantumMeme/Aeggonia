One of the more complicated of nations in the coalition. It's less of a cohesive clan in of itself, and more of a massive, evershifting collective of goblin hordes that "vote" every so often when a decision is needed. They have agreed to keep their squabbles away from main roads and the other nations, and considering how quickly goblins reproduce they make a killing off of the slave trade. A unified Xaasbaanian force does exist specifically to protect trade routes-- two soldiers from each clan take part in it.

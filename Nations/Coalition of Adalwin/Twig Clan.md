The last of the three unified clans. The twig clan believes the old ways are the only ways. The teachings of the Highfang should not be interpreted, only taken at their word. They build their infrastructure from mud brick and stone, prefering to be as defensive and seclusionist as possible so that they may worship properly for all time. They are obsessed with simplicity, though they are impeccable at armor craft. Much of their society is laden with underground tunnels and as such they have access to quite a bit of metal. They shuffle around in thick, heavy metal plate, using traps to ward off any invaders/visitors.

They spend all of their time in prayer. This is what the Highfang wanted.

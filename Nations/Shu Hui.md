## General Lore

Thirty years ago, the Blood Rebellion began. A violent uprising had been staged in Xuanhua, the primary port in the east of the Jiaian Guo empire. From there the word of revolution would spread. Countless citizens would join the united front, all seeking to topple the tyranny of the eternal Guo dynasty-- all seeking to let the monarch's blood run in the streets.

The woman at the head of this revolution is **Fang Xue**, and her followers are endlessly loyal. She preaches unity not in blood, but in ideals. To bring power to the working class, rights to the oppressed. She preaches that the loyalists must pay with their blood, and they are doing them a favor by slaughtering them en masse.

If it isn't apparent already, every battle they have with the Empire ends in a massive loss of life. They do not accept their surrender, only their fealty. Every other country respects their sovereignty and supports their cause, although their recent actions have made it rather difficult to support. A tradition once kept hidden from the world has made it out in the forms of rumors; Fang Xue has her followers imbibe in the blood of their enemies, treating the loyalists like prey.

But, hey, anything for freedom.

### Lore
This is Fang Xue. The revolutionary leader fighting against the Jian Guo Empire. Charismatic, powerful, and merciless against those she deems as oppressors. Her soldiers and followers give unquestioning loyalty to her by their own volition-- truly. No mind control, no thralls, no servitude. They fight because they believe in the cause. However... she _is_ a lich. She doles out her soul via her blood to each soldier that joins their ranks in an initiation ritual that simply involves drinking from a chalice of wine-- a chalice stolen from one of the manors that they had already claimed and burned belonging to the Guo family name. They're also given a citrine earring to wear as a sign of fealty. And because she's a lich, her power is directly tied with how many soldiers she has beneath her. Not to mention that whenever those soldiers claim a life in combat, she gains the victim's strength in turn. Thus its a no brainer to teach that the vicious tyrants holding them down deserve no mercy and deserve brutality. She benefits directly from it, and there's one less putrid noble breathing the same air as them.

# Announcement

There is a nigh-eternal war occurring within Adalwin with the Flame Clan at its forefront. The Overgrowth is ever-growing and it must be beaten back by any means necessary. These means generally come in the form of Magiaslavic aid, but given the tumultuous political situation between the borders of each tribe and clan contained in this cavalcade of cartels it is difficult to ensure that every bit of a shipment will arrive on time. This is where some of you come in. You have been tasked with transporting the shipment of supplies through the home stretch-- the caravan from one side of the Flame Clan to the other. You are all simply mercenaries with no real loyalty to the clan itself, but this job in particular pays quite handsomely. However, it's not bandits you have to worry about within the borders of the clan. No, not at all. Instead you must contend with the zealots of Spark-- a new 'sovereign' tribe defending is borders in the dead center of the clan. These zealots are dangerous, unhinged, seemingly amoral, and most importantly they cut into your profits. You're not entirely sure _what_ you're transporting (not that you're allowed to know anyhow) but it's clear that they want it badly. Stop them by any means necessary.

On the other hand... some of you might have faith in the Spine. You may have heard it speak to you, ringing deafeningly between your ears, vibrating your skull, squeezing your brain. And what a loving embrace that squeeze can be. It tells you that there is something it wants being guarded by flecks of hostile scum wheeling across its rightful land. It orders you to take it-- slaughter the interlopers and retrieve the wondrous contents of the crates they tote. They are relics of its Majesty, after all.

--

I want a relatively even distribution of players on either side. I'll probably invite maybe two more people max for this since it's primarily going to be PVP in the center of it. There will be NPCs to help both sides. Fodder, mainly, but helpful nonetheless.

Characters will be level 9. Any class goes. Please avoid spells like dominate person and things like that because that's no fun in PVP. 
I will also note that more often than not, Spark cultists tend to be tabaxi. Not always, but that's what you ought to expect.

### Terrain Mechanics
- **Earthen Boils**
	- Cracked pockets of earth hiss angrily as an inferno presses against the packed surface, eager to escape but held back by mere inches of dirt. A wayward step atop such a pocket is enough to cause it to erupt, engulfing the area briefly in flame .
	- If stepped on, **DC17 DEX** save against 4d6 fire damage or half on success.
	- If attacked, **AC of 13** and **10HP**
- **Ember Swarms**
	- Floating aimlessly throughout the battlefield are clouds of searing embers. They drift among the heat with no ill-intent-- though if one enters their wake it may become a problem.
	- The first time someone enters an ember swarm, and at the start of every subsequent turn one must make a **DC14 CON** save against 2d4 fire damage.
- **Rebirth Incarnate**
	- Fire is the element of passion-- of rage-- of fury. These features coalesce into wandering entities known as Reborn-- though in reality they are simply fire elementals. They are hostile to anything living and have a 5% chance of appearing whenever an earthen boil pops.

# Actual Events

## Mercenaries 

Oy. Another day, another coin, right fellas?

You know the drill. You folk are each being paid a hefty sum for this job. **3000 gold**. You've already received half up-front, so backing out ain't an option no more. This trip'll take ya through the belly of the Flame Clan, so you know what's comin'. Sweaty, suffocating, downright shitty heat. Maybe a few beasties to contend with, some unfortunate fissures in some inconvenient places-- maybe even a raid from the cultists. 

Ya should be fine, though. You wouldn't let a couple of crystalline crackheads cut into your cut, would ya?

Thought not.

By the way. You ain't allowed to peek at the goods. That's part of the deal that the Mags cut with us to get you paid so handsomely. And if you see a cultist? Kill 'em before they kill you. They're downright lunatics, ain't worth protecting, ain't worth convincing. 

'Course, you ain't gonna just be rawdogging hell on earth. We've got some supplies for ya. Also-- a bit of advice. The cultists are a big fan of blowing themselves up. Do your best not to be too close to them when they do.

Cheers.

### Resources
- **Frost Dome**
	- Attached to the cart is a long, copper rod with a what looks to be a thick buckler attached to the top. It was hollowed, comprised of two layers rattling atop one another. It hums with magic as a dome is cast around the entire party-- a 20-foot radius.
	- **EFFECTS**: Resistance against fire damage.
- **Flares**
	- Call for reinforcements. This _will_ cost you your deposit, netting you a loss of 1000 gold in order to pay the new fighters that will try to arrive in time. Emphasis on _try_.

## Cultists

_Your brain jiggles within your skull as the crystal embedded in your forehead buzzes with intent. Kistaleda, the intercessor to the Spine is relaying its exalted words into your eagerly awaiting minds. She speaks in a jovial yet hoarse tone, though some words sound as though as they are spoken by many discordant voices at once._

Hellooooo, my little vertebrae!

Rejoice, for there is a new opportunity to prove your faith to the god of gods! A simple task, an easy one! One your brethren have done before!

**RETURN MY FLESH.**

A heavily defended trade cart is to be brushing past the hallowed ground we claim, said to contain pieces of our Lord within! Your task is to retrieve it... and to **KILL THOSE WHO OPPOSE ME.**

You will have about an hour to prepare for their arrival. Do what you must, do all that you can-- bring glory to the glorious, and shame to the shameful!

Remember~ Better to die than to come empty-handed!

Byebye!

### Resources

- **Martyrdom**
	- You concentrate on nothing but prayer and exaltation as you run towards the enemy. Fingers on your temples you scream the words you're taught-- a spell in Primordial. You don't know what it means exactly, but you do know what comes next.
	- **Cost**: An action. At the end of your next turn, you will explode violently. You will die. No death saves, no nothing. You will die.
	- **Effect**: Pure, unadulterated mana bursts forth from you in a **10ft radius**. Players caught within must make a **DC16 dex save** against **8d8** *fire* damage or half on success. The area is now marred with a crater.
- **Crystalline Constructs**
	- The Spine has graciously bestowed unto you **three** constructs to aid in your battle. Their statblocks are as follows.

	![[crystalline construct.png]]
- **Attunable Crystals**
	- You have been given a gift. A very nice gift, at that. **Two** crystals that can do different things depending on your choices. You can place them anywhere on the battlefield.
	- *Heal*: If a creature ends their turn within 10ft of this crystal, they receive d8+4 health back
	- *Harm*: If a creature ends their turn within 10ft of this crystal, they take d4+4 necrotic damage.
	- *Cool*: So long as a creature is within 10ft of this crystal, they have resistance to fire damage.
	- *Heat:* So long as a creature is within 10ft of this crystal, they are vulnerable to fire damage.
	- *Turret*: A crystal floats above a shattered platform, lightning dancing in violent arcs across its shimmering surface. This is a weapon you can man. **Ranged weapon attack (dex):** 60/120, one target. *Hit* 1d12+4 lightning damage.

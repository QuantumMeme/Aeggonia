# Announcement

There is a nigh-eternal war occurring within Adalwin with the Flame Clan at its forefront. The Overgrowth is ever-growing and it must be beaten back by any means necessary. These means generally come in the form of Magiaslavic aid, but given the tumultuous political situation between the borders of each tribe and clan contained in this cavalcade of cartels it is difficult to ensure that every bit of a shipment will arrive on time. This is where some of you come in. You have been tasked with transporting the shipment of supplies through the home stretch-- the caravan from one side of the Flame Clan to the other. You are all simply mercenaries with no real loyalty to the clan itself, but this job in particular pays quite handsomely. However, it's not bandits you have to worry about within the borders of the clan. No, not at all. Instead you must contend with the zealots of Spark-- a new 'sovereign' tribe defending is borders in the dead center of the clan. These zealots are dangerous, unhinged, seemingly amoral, and most importantly they cut into your profits. You're not entirely sure _what_ you're transporting (not that you're allowed to know anyhow) but it's clear that they want it badly. Stop them by any means necessary.

On the other hand... some of you might have faith in the Spine. You may have heard it speak to you, ringing deafeningly between your ears, vibrating your skull, squeezing your brain. And what a loving embrace that squeeze can be. It tells you that there is something it wants being guarded by flecks of hostile scum wheeling across its rightful land. It orders you to take it-- slaughter the interlopers and retrieve the wondrous contents of the crates they tote. They are relics of its Majesty, after all.

--

I want a relatively even distribution of players on either side. I'll probably invite maybe two more people max for this since it's primarily going to be PVP in the center of it. There will be NPCs to help both sides. Fodder, mainly, but helpful nonetheless.

Characters will be level 9. Any class goes. Please avoid spells like dominate person and things like that because that's no fun in PVP. 
I will also note that more often than not, Spark cultists tend to be tabaxi. Not always, but that's what you ought to expect.

# Actual Events

## Mercenaries 

Each individual is being paid a hefty sum for this job. **2000 gold**. You already received half up-front, so you're not exactly able to back out now. You know what's coming. Sweaty, sweltering, suffocating heat. Perhaps a few beasts to contend with, some unfortunate fissures in inconvenient places-- perhaps even a raid from the cultists. Should be fine, though, right? I mean, it's just lunatics.

### Resources
- **Frost Dome**
	- Attached to the cart is a long, copper rod with a what looks to be a thick buckler attached to the top. It was hollowed, comprised of two layers rattling atop one another. It hums with magic as a dome is cast around the entire party-- a 20-foot radius.
	- **EFFECTS**: Resistance against fire damage.
- **Flares**
	- Call for reinforcements. This _will_ cost you your deposit, netting you a loss of 1000 gold in order to pay the new fighters that will try to arrive in time.


### NPCs

## Cultists

The Spine thinks its glorious thoughts through your own-- the crystal in your skull harmonizes with the exalted one within the center of the hallowed land you live in. He who intercedes, Kistaledes, tells you of its ideals. It buzzes with one continuous thought-- one task for you and your brethren.

*RETURN MY FLESH*

Those bastards wheeling through the flametouched land carry your Lord's flesh-- cut from its body and stolen-- only to be destroyed by the Flame Clan. This cannot be allowed to happen. You must stop them and retrieve the artifacts in one piece.


### Resources

- **Martyrdom**
	- You concentrate on nothing but prayer and exaltation as you run towards the enemy. Fingers on your temples you scream the words you're taught-- a spell in Abyssal. You don't know what it means exactly, but you do know what comes next.
	- **Cost**: An action. At the end of your next turn, you will explode violently. You will die. No death saves, no nothing. You will die.
	- **Effect**: Pure, unadulterated mana bursts forth from you in a 10ft radius. Players caught within must make a DC16 dex save against **8d8** *force* damage or half on success. The area is now marred with a crater.
